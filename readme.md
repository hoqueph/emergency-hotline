# Question 1 : What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?

Ans: Difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll : 
getElementById: Selects a single element by its id and returns an Single element or null if does not exists.

getElementsByClassName: Selects elements (multiple) by their class name and returns live HTMLCollection.

querySelector: Selects the first element matching a CSS selector and returns Single element or null if doesn't exists. Useful when there is no id defined.

querySelectorAll: Selects all elements matching a CSS selectorand returns a static NodeList.

# Question 2 : How do you create and insert a new element into the DOM?
Ans: To create a DOM element, we use the Document.CreateElement method and in it, we write the tag that we want to create the element between double quotations or single quotations and if we want to open it in DOM, what we can do is Document.Body. Using this method, we can append an element to the document or inside a DOM element.

# Question 3 : What is Event Bubbling and how does it work?
Ans: Event bubbling is when we use click event or any event on child element then it is first applied on child element then applied on parent element and then applied on grant element then on document then on window and this the Event bubbling.

# Question 4 : What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
Ans: Event Delegation: Event delegation is a technique in JavaScript where a single event listener is attached to a parent element, instead of attaching event listeners to individual child elements.It is useful because it improves performance by reducing the number of event listeners attached to multiple child elements, especially in scenarios where there are many child elements or dynamically added ones. It also simplifies the code by centralizing event handling, making it easier to manage.

# Question 5 : What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods?
Ans: Difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation():
preventDefault(): It prevents the default behavior associated with an event from occurring. It is used when we want to stop the browserâ€™s default action for the event. 

stopPropagation(): It prevents the event from bubbling up or propagating to its parent elements in the DOM. It is used when we want to stop the event from reaching other event listeners higher up in the DOM tree.
